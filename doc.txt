_hash-store_
==========================================

By Jay McCarthy <jay.mccarthy@gmail.com>

Keywords: _database_

Introduction
============

A simple content-addressed storage layer.

You probably want to wrap this in a caching layer, like one of my
other packages.

This is used is some of my web applications to give user's keys to
persistent data.

FILES
====
_sha1.ss_
---------------

Require it like this:

> (require (planet "sha1.ss" ("jaymccarthy" "hash-store.plt" 1)))

It provides the follow identifiers:

> SHA1 : bytes? -> bytes?

_hash-store.ss_
---------------

Require it like this:

> (require (planet "hash-store.ss" ("jaymccarthy" "hash-store.plt" 1)))

It provides the follow identifiers:

> hash-store? : any/c -> boolean?

> create : path? -> hash-store?

> store! : hash-store? bytes? -> bytes?

If the bytes are already in the store, there is no writing. The
hash-code is returned.

> lookup : hash-store? bytes? -> bytes?

If the bytes are the key of something in the store, return that thing.

> exn:fail:hash-store:exists? : any/c -> boolean?

Thrown when `lookup' fails.

Example

See _test.ss_
